NEWS for package xlsx

Changes in version 0.2.1 (released 2010-05-15)

 o Fixed bug with write.xlsx.  It does not write colnames even if
 col.names=TRUE.  Reported by Ralf Tautenhahn.

 o Added an ... arg to read.xlsx that is passed to the data.frame
 constructor, for example to control the stringsAsFactors option. 
 


Changes in version 0.2.0 (released 2010-05-01)

 o Switched to POI 3.6.  This resulted in significant memory
 improvements but will still run into memory issues when
 reading/writing large xlsx files.  
 
 o Added addPicture function for embedding pictures into xlsx files. 

 o Added removeRow function for conveniently removing existing rows
 from the spreadsheet.

 o Added/Fixed comments for cells.  See ?Comment 

 o Fixed bug in read.xlsx for the case when the file contains only
 one column (issue reported by Hans Petersen), a corner case when
 drop=TRUE wrecked havoc. 

 o Fixed bug in createRow.  If rowIndex did not start at 1, it
 created spurious NULL entries.  

Changes in version 0.1.3  (released 2010-03-15)

 o Added indCol argument to getCells in case you want to get only a
 subset of columns. 

 o Added function getMatrixValue to extract blocks of data from the sheet.

 o Improved and expanded the unit tests.

 o On Mac, you cannot set colors directly using createCellStyle.  You
 can still do it manually, please see the javadocs.

Changes in version 0.1.2  (released 2010-01-02)

 o Fixed getRows, getCells so it does not error out for empty
 rows/cells.  Modified read.xlsx too. 

 o Added append argument to write.xlsx to be able to export to
 multiple worksheets of a file.  (Suggestion by rlearnr@gmail.com.)
