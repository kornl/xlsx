NEWS for package xlsx

Changes in version 0.2.3 (released 2010-08-26)

 o Fix the hAlign and vAlign arguments in createCellStyle.  The
 internal method call was lacking a cast to jshort.  Reported by
 Douglas Rivers. 

 o Fix getCellValue when you have formulas with String values (it
 assumed Numeric values and errored out for other types).  Support now
 Strings and Booleans.  Error out for other cell types.  Don't know a
 sound solution.  Reported by ravi(?) rv15i@yahoo.se.


Changes in version 0.2.2 (released 2010-07-14)

 o Added a colIndex argument to read.xlsx to facilitate reading only
 specific columns. 

 o setCellValue now tests for NA, and if value is NA, it will fill the
 cell with #N/A. 

 o Fixed bug in getCellValue.  It now returns NA for all the error
 codes in the cell.  It used to return a numeric code which was
 confusing to the R user.  Reported by Ralf Tautenhahn. 
 

Changes in version 0.2.1 (released 2010-05-15)

 o Fixed bug with write.xlsx.  It does not write colnames even if
 col.names=TRUE.  Reported by Ralf Tautenhahn.

 o Added an ... arg to read.xlsx that is passed to the data.frame
 constructor, for example to control the stringsAsFactors option. 
 

Changes in version 0.2.0 (released 2010-05-01)

 o Switched to POI 3.6.  This resulted in significant memory
 improvements but will still run into memory issues when
 reading/writing large xlsx files.  
 
 o Added addPicture function for embedding pictures into xlsx files. 

 o Added removeRow function for conveniently removing existing rows
 from the spreadsheet.

 o Added/Fixed comments for cells.  See ?Comment 

 o Fixed bug in read.xlsx for the case when the file contains only
 one column (issue reported by Hans Petersen), a corner case when
 drop=TRUE wrecked havoc. 

 o Fixed bug in createRow.  If rowIndex did not start at 1, it
 created spurious NULL entries.  


Changes in version 0.1.3  (released 2010-03-15)

 o Added indCol argument to getCells in case you want to get only a
 subset of columns. 

 o Added function getMatrixValue to extract blocks of data from the sheet.

 o Improved and expanded the unit tests.

 o On Mac, you cannot set colors directly using createCellStyle.  You
 can still do it manually, please see the javadocs.

Changes in version 0.1.2  (released 2010-01-02)

 o Fixed getRows, getCells so it does not error out for empty
 rows/cells.  Modified read.xlsx too. 

 o Added append argument to write.xlsx to be able to export to
 multiple worksheets of a file.  (Suggestion by rlearnr@gmail.com.)
