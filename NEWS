Changes in version 0.1.3  (released 2010-03-15)

 o Added indCol argument to getCells in case you want to get only a
 subset of columns. 

 o Added function getMatrixValue to extract blocks of data from the sheet.

 o Improved and expanded the unit tests.

 can still do it manually, please see the javadocs.

Changes in version 0.1.2  (released 2010-01-02)

 o Fixed getRows, getCells so it does not error out for empty
 rows/cells.  Modified read.xlsx too.
